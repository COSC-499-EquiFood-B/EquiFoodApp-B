## Introduction & Problem to be solved
Introducing Equifood, our community-driven app that promotes sustainability by lessening food waste production in BC. Our app is designed to facilitate a process for restaurants to reduce the amount of food en route to landfills at the end of every night. The app has a simple design where restaurants are able to upload unsold food items at a reduced price, and individual users are able to reserve said items. With a streamlined and intuitive user interface, Equifood is the go-to choice for an eco-friendly dining solution.
How app is structured
The app is created for three types of user groups, including: the everyday user, restaurants, and administrators. All three user groups share the same app, with a flexible switch between the login options.
Reserving donations
For the everyday user, EquiFood makes it easy to discover the available restaurants and food details  with just a few clicks. Once you find a meal that you like, we will reserve it for a limited time while you are on your way to pick up the item.
