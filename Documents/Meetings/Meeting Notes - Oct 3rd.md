possible (before oct 7th)

not fixed

## App Notes:
- client would prefer if app is available on both apple and android, but it is not a
requirement
- completely open to tech stack
- client is strict that there should be no payment gateway â€“ the app simply shows available
food options for an individual to go pick up
- the restaurant should be offering meals (no raw foods or ingredients)
- the restaurant uploads the foods available within the last few hours that they are open, it
is up to the restaurant to update their information
- the food a restaurant provides can vary everyday
