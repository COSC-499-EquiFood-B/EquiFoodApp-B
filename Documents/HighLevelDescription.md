# High Level Description
Restaurants are one of the biggest producers of food waste, and Equifood is a mobile app designed to help combat that statistic. 

Through the app restaurants are able to offer up their leftover food for free or at a significantly reduced price. 

Not only does this decrease the amount of food thrown away at the end of the night, but also enables consumers to enjoy the food at a subsidized price. 

By consequence, the app creates a symbiotic relationship between both consumers and restaurants. 

Additionally, to highlight the impact the app has on the community, Equifood also automatically tracks the actual dollar amount of food given away.

## Equifood has three types of users:
### 1. The Individual:
      the individual is able to log into the app, connect with a restaurant and obtain food
### 2. The Restaurant:
	    the restaurant is able to post donations on the app and manage their information
### 3. Administrators:
	    the admin team approves of restaurants and views donations amounts
