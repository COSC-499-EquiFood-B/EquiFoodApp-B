# Requirements:
- The students will build a mobile app that would connect restaurants with individuals in order to allow the individuals to obtain the restaurants' food leftovers for free or at a significantly reduced price. The app will also streamline EquiFood's current donations tracking process, as it will automatically keep track of the money amount worth of food that EquiFood has contributed to donating via its restaurant partners, which is currently done manually. The system will involve three types of users
    1. Individuals: anyone who signs up on the app to be connected to restaurant and obtain food donations.
    2. Restaurant representatives: restaurant managers or their delegate who are able to post donations onto the system and manage their restaurant’s information in the EquiFood app. These users must be vetted by the administrators.
    3. Administrators: members of the EquiFood team who can approve restaurant managers and view the donation amounts.
