# Requirements Presentation - Minh's Script

## Intro
- Hi everyone we’re from team B of the EquiFood project, and today we will be giving a quick overview of our project’s requirements and how we are planning to approach it in the upcoming months.

## Functional Requirements
- Now I will be going over the functional requirements for each of the user groups.

- Firstly, the admin which is our client for now, should be able to
    - Approve restaurants after they have registered to the app for the first time
    - Remove existing restaurants from the database
    - View the total donation value for each restaurant
    - View the accumulated donation value for all restaurants in a selected time frame
    
- For the second use case, which is the restaurant, the required features are:
    - Post a donation (description, thumbnail, price, quantity)
    - Edit the donation details
    - Remove an existing donation
      - Mark donations as completed after someone has picked them up

- Now for the most frequent use case, which is the day-to-day user, some of the requirements are to
    - View available donations from the dashboard
    - View the donation details
      - Reserve a donation for pickup
      - Review the reservation and pickup location on Google Maps
      - Have an option to contact the restaurant
      - Add restaurants to a favorites list (Notified)
      
- And finally, all of the users in these 3 use cases should be able to:
    - Create an account
    - Login into an existing account
      - Edit their account details
      - Enable push notifications, for example when a bookmarked restaurant recently added a new donation
