# EquiFood Team B - Usability Tasks

## User Group: Individual Users

### Scenario: 
In an ideal scenario, the individual user will be able to open the app, and then seamlessly log in through their preferred method (i.e. either through email or a google account). Once logged in, the user should be brought to the restaurant dashboard page. At the restaurant dashboard, the user should be able to scroll through a list of restaurants displaying their available donations, or be able to search for the restaurant they desire. Once a restaurant is selected, the user should be able to view details about the restaurant and their food offering as well as be able to reserve an item for pickup. The reservation should be confirmed with a corresponding confirmation screen, and they should also be able to cancel their order. Moreover the user should be able visit a settings page where they can edit their information. Lastly, the user should be able to access a donation summary page where they are able to view statistics relating to the appâ€™s impact on food waste reduction.
