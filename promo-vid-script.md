## Introduction & Problem to be solved
Introducing Equifood, our community-driven app that promotes sustainability by lessening food waste production in BC. Our app is designed to facilitate a process for restaurants to reduce the amount of food en route to landfills at the end of every night. The app has a simple design where restaurants are able to upload unsold food items at a reduced price, and individual users are able to reserve said items. With a streamlined and intuitive user interface, Equifood is the go-to choice for an eco-friendly dining solution.
## How app is structured
The app is created for three types of user groups, including: the everyday user, restaurants, and administrators. All three user groups share the same app, with a flexible switch between the login options.
## Reserving donations
For the everyday user, EquiFood makes it easy to discover the available restaurants and food details  with just a few clicks. Once you find a meal that you like, we will reserve it for a limited time while you are on your way to pick up the item.
## Creating donations
Restaurants can use EquiFood to create donations for their available meals at the end of the night. They can modify the details of these items and delete them if desired.
## Approving restaurants
The administrators are responsible for approving restaurants to participate in the EquiFood app. Their main goal is to  review applications and decide whether the restaurant is a good fit based on a range of criteria.
## Statistics
EquiFood provides users with access to valuable statistics, such as how much money they've saved or how much food they've helped save from going to a landfill. These statistics help promote the usage of the app and encourage users to keep up the good work.
## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to discover Equifood. We're confident that our app will exceed your expectations and provide you with the solutions you need to help reduce food waste today!
